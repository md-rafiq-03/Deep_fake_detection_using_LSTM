# Deep-Fake-Detection
 -- We have utilized LSTM model for deepfake detection

## Project Overview:

In this Colab project, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of deepfake detection models, focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures. Our goal was to assess and contrast the performance of these models in identifying deepfake videos.

## Experimental Setup:

- **Platform:** Google Colab
- **GPU:** NVIDIA T4
- **Python Version:** 3.10.12
- **Libraries:**
  - Torch (PyTorch) for deep learning
  - OpenCV (cv2) for video and image processing
  - Seaborn for visualization
  - Numpy for numerical operations


## Result:

- **LSTM Model Accuracy:** Approximately 83% on the DFDC dataset.
